### How to use ü§î
He has 2 solutions to use this module

- First you have to recover the current seasons array with the `getCurrentSeasonsArray()` function.

```typescript
import { getCurrentSeasonsArray } from 'get-current-season-with-date';

let currentSeasonsArray = getCurrentSeasonsArray();
```

After this, you just have to call the `getCurrentSeasonIdByArray()` function for getting the current season ID

```typescript
import { getCurrentSeasonsArray, getCurrentSeasonIdByArray } from 'get-current-season-with-date';

let currentSeasonsArray = getCurrentSeasonsArray();
let currentSeasonId = getCurrentSeasonIdByArray(currentSeasonsArray);

return currentSeasonId;
//> 1, 2, 3 or 4
```

- If you don't need to recover the seasons array, you can simply call `getCurrentSeasonIdByArray()` without the array (he will automatically generate it)

```typescript
import { getCurrentSeasonIdByArray } from 'get-current-season-with-date';

let currentSeasonId = getCurrentSeasonIdByArray();

return currentSeasonId;
//> 1, 2, 3 or 4
```

To recover a season with an ID, you just have to do it as above but by adding `getSeasonById` function

```typescript
import { getCurrentSeasonIdByArray, getSeasonById } from 'get-current-season-with-date';

let currentSeasonId = getCurrentSeasonIdByArray();
let currentSeason = getSeasonById(currentSeasonId);

return currentSeason;
//> Spring, Summer, Fall or Winter
```

### Internationalization üåç
You can change the language of the output season with the locales made by yourself

```typescript
import { getCurrentSeasonIdByArray, getSeasonById } from 'get-current-season-with-date';

let currentSeasonId = getCurrentSeasonIdByArray();
let currentSeason = getSeasonById(currentSeasonId, {
    locale: {
        1: 'a',
        2: 'b',
        3: 'c',
        4: 'd'
    }
});

return currentSeason;
//> A, B, C or D
```

Last thing, adding the parameter `lowercaseSeason` to the options, you can choose with `true` or `false` if you want the first letter of the season to be uppercase or lowercase. Default is false

**If you want the API is available [here](docs/modules.md)**

### Development üõ†Ô∏è
If you want to modify something in the module you must first clone it

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YuZesky/get-current-season-with-date.git
```

Next download all the necessary dependencies

```
$ pnpm install
```

When you have changed the code, format it and launch the tests (It can that if you add functions you will also have to add them in the tests)

```
$ pnpm run format && pnpm run test
```

When everything is good, you can compile the code and the documentary

```
$ pnpm run build && pnpm run doc
```
